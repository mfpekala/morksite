# The Frustrating Beauty of the Abstract Machine

_It goes all the way down._

## Hardware? Don't talk to me about hardware.

Generally, to be "someone" you have to know "something". For me, I like to think that I know "computers" which makes me a "programmer". The term "software engineer" has always felt a bit strange because I don't consider anything at the software layer to be "real". At best, writing software means thinking hard about the most efficient ways to organize imaginary things. At worst, it's grid-searching stack-overflow posts and accepting something works without really knowing why.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, this is one of the things I love most about programming. Because the problems programmers solve are so abstract, the solution space is massive. Everything is essentially one big math problem. You can iterate as much as you want without getting tied down in physics or plugging in wires.

For most of my life, hardware was something I didn't really think about. Occassionally I would buy old computers at garage sales and take them apart, but when I was writing code the computer was nothing more than a screen that showed me the thing I was expecting some fraction of the time. I accepted everything that happened under the hood as either magic or too boring to be worth my time.

And for the most part, this is a massive success. It's no doubt that eons of engineering time have gone into making the computer so functional and well-defined that it's abstractions can be understood by anyone with at least half a brain. It is the greatest thing humans have ever created.

But on another level, it's deeply frustrating. If someone were to hand me a computer that was doing weird computer things (as we've all experienced before), would I stand any chance of fixing it? For example, for the past few weeks my Mac has been restarting because it claims to have hundreds of gigabytes of system files it can't delete. Is there an answer to this? Obviously yes. Am I ever going to figure it out? Unless someone responds to my stack overflow post, probably not.

## An aside: A very much non-abstract machine

This past summer I took a job in Palo Alto and bought a \$2000 car with my roommate. Most people that I've told this too have been shocked, but to us it made plenty of sense. First, we're cheap. Second, what better way to learn about cars than buying one you know will probably break while having your livelihood depend on your ability to drive to work?
