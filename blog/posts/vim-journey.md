# Graphing My Vim Journey

## Backstory

About six months ago, I decided to learn vim. Previous to that I'm embarrased to admit that I was a pleb VSCode-r with a moderate amount of custom keyboard shortcuts, mostly for navigating between editors and to/from the terminal. (_HoW cAN I eVEN caLl mYSElf a PROgrAmER?_) I wanted to learn vim for two main reasons:

1. I was tired of aching pain in my hands as a 20s-something computer person.
2. I felt at times that lining up precise mouse mouse clicks was the main thing slowing me down in day-to-day work (besides \*occasional\* thinking and planning).

So I decided that for my first couple of months using Vim, I'd track my mouse activity so I could quantify how impactful the change was.[^1]

## Hypotheses

Before learning vim, I had read a fair amount of _"vim is hard but awesome"_ blog posts and had some expectations for what the process would be like. Here were my expectations going in:

1. **Short-term cost.** I was expecting to feel substantially less productive for about ~2 weeks before having enough muscle memory to do interesting stuff.[^2]
2. **Fewer mouse clicks, less mouse movement.** Self explanatory. I wanted to be able to go the whole day only touching my mouse a handful of times.
3. **Less Pain.** I didn't think my hand pain would go away entirely, but I was hoping that it would take longer to set in.
4. (Optional) **Strike fear in my enemies.**

[^1]: Then I decided I'd wait four months to write a blog post on it.</br>
[^2]: This was conditional on my decision to go "all-in" on vim, not allowing myself to use old bindings. I'm sure if I was more forgiving I could've spread this cost thinner.
