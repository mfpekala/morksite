# To Our Many, Many Users

It is with a heavy heart that today I must take down [numcross.com](https://numcross.com). Who would've guessed that a side project by a few college seniors would become an overnight hit with millions of users, spiraling completely out of our control?

I certainly wouldn't have. I would've guessed that like most side projects, we'd make it, improve it for a few months, force some of our friends to use it, complain that "the world simply isn't ready for it", get bored, move onto something else, and then begrugingly pay Amazon $70 a month for half a year until we decided it was time to take it down because we were too lazy to not use Docker.

But dear user, I must assure you that did _not_ happen. You can imagine that with a jabillion DAUs, unimaginably high PMF, and a few other acronyms you haven't even heard of, numcross was simply too much for us to manage.

Hopefully this change isn't forever, but for the time being it's time to say goodbye. Thanks for all the memories.
